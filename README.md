# Simplex-Method-with-Python-

Introduction - 

This Project contains implementations of linear program solver algorithms in Python and NumPy:

    1. Simplex algorithm  
  
    2. Primal-Dual Infeasible [Interior Point]    

    3. Brute force algorithm (exhaustive search over all possible bases)

Results-

1. We test `SimplexSolver` and `InteriorPointSolver` on two separate max-flow instances.

2. The total flow leaving source (vertex-0) in the above flow assignment (16 + 10 = 26) is equal to the sum of the capacities of edges going out of the cut shown above in green (12 + 14 = 26). Hence, this flow assignment is optimal.

3. The total flow leaving source (vertex-0) in the above flow assignment (11 + 8 + 10 = 29) is equal to the sum of the capacities of edges going out of the cut shown above in green (11 + 3 + 5 + 10 = 29). Hence, this flow assignment is optimal.
